= Users Module

While this is indeed called **Users Module**, we have to get something out the way. 
The **_basic user_**, the one that is key in order for the whole system to function and actually generate value is the **BOOKKEEPER**. This is the one user that can manage all the data that goes into the system that will then power charts, reports, and everything else.

The module in concept is pretty simple, only cares about CRUD operations in regards 
to bookkeepers, there are _"super users"_ in charge of this called **SysAdmin**. 
These users have to be created manually (by the hands of a developer), although 
there are xref:backend:net-modulith.adoc[automations] around it.
