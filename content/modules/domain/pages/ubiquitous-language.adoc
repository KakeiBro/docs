= Ubiquitous Language

Following DDD's design principles, a ubiquitous language is neccesary for us in 
order to speak both on the dev side and on the business side of things. This page 
is focused entirely on the key terms that both the reality of the problem and 
the system uses and their definitions. A glossary in short.

2FA::
Two Factor Authentication. The method used for logging in with a timed-code that 
a user's device (usually a smartphone) generates. It adds an extra layer of security 
to an account.
OAuth::
The protocol that is used with Google Services in order to authenticate with them 
and get back a _yes_ or _no_ response for a login attempt.
Bookkeeper::
This is the base user that will use the system the most and runs most of the 
workflows. Adds, edits, deletes data alongside querying it in its various forms.
SysAdmin::
This is a super-user that gets access to user management, CRUDs of _bookkeepers_, 
reset credentials.
