== High Level Architecture

Without getting into the weeds of it just yet, we will make use of a UML Component 
Diagram in order to explain how the application is laid out:

=== React UI

When it comes to the UI side of things, a React with Vite application is the one 
powering the user interactions with the system.

Most important libraries:

- Vite
- Vitest
- Emotion (compiled css styles in order to UT css behaviors)
- Forms (TBD)
- Apache Graphs

=== .NET Modulith

Following the _Modular Monolith_ architecture, the backend is a single ASP.NET Restful 
API that runs everything as a monolith, but has enough logical and physical modularization 
that is easier to maintain, extend but also faster to migrate to something like microservices.

**_Another way to look at it is a hybrid between a Monolith and Microservices._**

Inside of it we have the following modules identified:

Users:: Module focused entirely on the management of the users that can access 
the system. It will integrate with Google's OAuth, and possibly with MFA.
Finances:: Module focused entirely on the management of both the management of data 
and visualization of **_to the point_** indicators of personal finances.
Intelligence:: Module focused entirely on more complex and insightful graphs, charts, 
tables that process all the finances data and give a much more round outlook on the 
health and areas of improvement for an individual's finances.

=== Redis Database

Redis is a fully-fledged Database solution, focused on speed and with great extensions to 
its base service, whilst its behavior by default is an on-memory database. It also 
has integrations with files written into disk for persistency reasons, alongside OM 
(Object Mapping) capabilities that allow for an easy _EF-Core_ like developer experience.

=== Disk File

This is the last part of the integration, whilst not a service itself, it's a system 
file this will power Redis in order to keep data persistent (and allow for backing up 
extensions). By restoring state from a file the moment the service boots up, we can keep 
a consistent state of all the financial information.
