= Intelligence Module

The **Intelligence Module** focuses on more fine-grained, granular and complex techniques 
plus concepts, leveraged, in order to provide more refined, actionable and rounded 
insights of the finances one is managing.

_As an excerpt from theory:_ Financial intelligence dashboards rely on various 
chart types to visualize data effectively and provide actionable insights. 
The choice of chart depends on the data being represented and the kind of insights 
needed. Some commonly used chart types can be:

== Chart Types

=== Time Series Charts

Line Chart::
Tracks financial metrics like revenue, expenses, or stock prices over time.
Ideal for identifying trends, seasonality, and patterns.
Candlestick Chart::
Commonly used in stock market analysis to show open, close, high, and low prices 
for a specific time frame.
Area Chart::
Similar to line charts but with filled areas, useful for emphasizing the magnitude 
of trends.

=== Comparison Charts

Bar Chart::
Used for comparing financial metrics like revenue across regions, departments, 
or products.
Column Chart::
Similar to bar charts but vertical; good for comparing categories over time.
Stacked Bar/Column Chart::
Displays subcategories within total amounts, such as expense breakdowns.

=== Distribution Charts

Histogram::
Shows frequency distribution of financial data, like sales by transaction size.
Box Plot::
Useful for spotting outliers and variability in financial metrics like profit 
margins.

=== Composition Charts

Pie Chart::
Illustrates proportions, such as market share or budget allocation. Works best for 
small numbers of categories.
Donut Chart::
A variation of the pie chart with a central space, often used for multitiered 
breakdowns.
Waterfall Chart::
Demonstrates how individual components contribute to a total, such as showing 
profits by adding revenues and subtracting costs.

=== Correlation and Relationships

Scatter Plot::
Shows relationships between two variables, such as revenue and customer 
acquisition cost.
Bubble Chart::
Adds a third dimension to scatter plots, using bubble size to represent an 
additional metric like market size.

=== Performance Tracking

Gauge/Speedometer Chart::
Displays key performance indicators (KPIs) like profit margins or sales goals.
Bullet Chart::
An advanced version of a bar chart to show performance against a target.

=== Hierarchical Charts

Tree Map::
Visualizes proportions within a hierarchy, such as portfolio allocations by asset 
class.
Sunburst Chart::
Similar to tree maps but circular; ideal for showing hierarchical data.

=== Forecasting and Advanced Analytics

Forecasting Line Chart::
Shows predicted trends alongside historical data.
Heat Map::
Displays financial performance intensity or correlations across regions, 
departments, or time.

=== Specialized Financial Charts

Gantt Chart::
Tracks project timelines and milestones for budgeting or cost analysis.
Pareto Chart::
Combines a bar chart and a line chart to identify the largest contributing factors 
to an issue, like expense categories.

=== Choosing the Right Chart

Trend Analysis:: Line charts, area charts.
Comparison:: Bar, column, and pie charts.
Relationships:: Scatter and bubble charts.
Details in Hierarchies:: Tree maps, sunburst charts.
Performance Metrics:: Bullet and gauge charts.

Combining multiple chart types into a dashboard often provides the most 
comprehensive insights. Selecting the right chart depends on the story you want 
to tell with your data.
