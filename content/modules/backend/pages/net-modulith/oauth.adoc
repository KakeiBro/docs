= OAuth

Since we are using **_Google OAuth_**, we have to make some configurations on the GCloud 
Console side so that it integrates seamlessly with our application(s).

As mentioned in the xref:prototypes:o-auth.adoc[prototypes section], we will have 
to register _Authorized JavaScript origins_ plus _Authorized redirect URIs_, and since 
we have setup with CI/CD our domains and services already, we are now 100% sure as 
to what should be registered there. Under the **Google Auth Plataform** section on 
GCloud Console:

* Frontend URI (Javascript): `https://kakeibro.dsbalderrama.top`
* Backend URI (redirect URIs): `https://kakeibro-api.dsbalderrama.top`

We should download **_the Client's JSON secret_**. And we should start leveraging that 
in order to talk to Google and allow us to start serving OAuth screens.
