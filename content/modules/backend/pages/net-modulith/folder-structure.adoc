= Folder Structure

The folder structure will adhere to **Vertical Slice Architecture** focused around the 
separation of concerns under a `Modulith` solution. Which means:

[NOTE]

This isn't the full folder structure, but a small representation of how it's logically 
ordered.

----
<.> We will have a _Common_ type of Class Library that all modules and apps can reference 
with base interfaces, extensions and classes that help us adhere to the rules of how all the 
architecture will be written.
<.> The `shared` class library will be denominated `Common.Library`.
<.> Inside of it we will have really high level and foundational interfaces that will 
help us declare the different classes that a module should have in order to declare the 
composition steps that will register both its endpoints, plus its services.
<.> All the `EndpointDefinitionExtensions`, `ModuleInstallerExtensions`, `ServiceInstallerExtensions` 
are the ones powering **_assembly scanning_**, making it possible for us to simply reference the different 
`AssemblyReference` markers on different modules, and from that one target, we can start composing the whole 
module by registering its services, its endpoints and so on.
<.> We will have a `Modules` folder in which all our module's will live (as Class 
Libraries completely independent of each other).
<.> Taking the Authentication Module as an example, we will have created a folder for 
the whole Module Class Library
<.> And it's inside _nested folders_ that we will have the **_slices_** in the form of 
use cases. Each Use Case (user flow) for the module will contain all that it's neccesary 
to it (from the endpoint all the way to the database specific concerns).
<.> Each Use case will have generic named files, for example for all endpoints related 
to the use case we will be following the pattern `<UseCase>Endpoints.cs`.
<.> And just like in the _endpoints_ case we will follow the same idea with a file for 
a repository, `<UseCase>Repository.cs`. It's worth noting that we chose to use the 
name of `Repository` however this could easily be named something else (such as `Service` 
or `BusinessLogic`), we are not leveraging the _Repository_ pattern in its entirety 
mainly because we have no use case (at least for now).
<.> Since the module has to deal with its own set of database technical concerns, we will 
have a _Generic_ folder named `Data` under the module, this wil encapsulate both 
the Entity objects that map to the database, plus migrations and other database centric 
operations.
<.> Since we will leverage assembly scanning for the registering of many of the components 
that make out our whole module, we should always have an `AssemblyReference.cs` file there, 
a marker, **WITHOUT ACTUAL FUNCTIONAL CODE**.
<.> An interesting concept that we will also make use of is the concept of a **_Module Installer_**, 
since all of our modules will be class libraries at their core, we need for an actual 
application to make use of their functionalities, and so, in order to register the 
module we will use the concept of **_Install_**. Which in short means that all the 
interfaces to which an app can hook into this module and register it, all of its 
endpoints, services, database concerns should be _injected_ through these interfaces.
<.> And in the spirit of keeping things simple, clean and organized, we will also separate 
by technical concern each registration for each different concern under a `ServiceInstallers` 
folder.
<.> For example, all repository registration logic should be under a specific `RepositoryServiceInstaller.cs` 
file.
<.> It's also at the same level of the `Modules` folder that we will have the actual 
Web API (the app) that will then install of the modules to it through the interfaces that 
we have laid out previously.
