= Git Hooks

Whilst xref:frontend:husky.adoc[in the Frontend] we are leveraging **Husky**, we are 
not really leveraging `node` in the frontend, this is entirely a .NET Solution. And so, 
we won't leverage that specific tool. In its place we will leverage **Git Hooks**, 
husky is a wrapper around git hooks by the end of the day.

Whilst `husky` helps bridging the gap between UNIX and Windows workstations, we have to 
setup a bit further when using raw _Git Hooks_ since depending on the OS the commands 
that run will not work on a case-by-case basis.

This is the order of steps used to setup the hooks:

. Create a hook file at `kakeibro-api/githooks/`
. You can test if the hooks are working as intended by running `git commit --amend --no-edit` 
followed then by `git push --force` (you could also just roll-back if you don't want 
to push anything).
