= Git Hooks

Whilst xref:frontend:husky.adoc[in the Frontend] we are leveraging **Husky**, we are 
not really leveraging `node` in the backend, this is entirely a .NET Solution. And so, 
we won't leverage that specific tool. In its place we will leverage **Git Hooks**, 
_Husky_ is a wrapper around git hooks by the end of the day.

Whilst `husky` helps bridging the gap between UNIX and Windows workstations, we have to 
setup a bit further when using raw _Git Hooks_ since depending on the OS the commands 
that run will not work on a case-by-case basis.

This is the order of steps used to setup a new hook:

. Create a hook file at `kakeibro-api/git-hooks/`
. You can test if the hooks are working as intended by running `git commit --amend --no-edit` 
followed then by `git push --force` (you could also just roll-back if you don't want 
to push anything).

[NOTE]
====
Make sure you have run the xref:ROOT:onboarding/index.adoc[Onboarding] first, otherwise 
none of the things stated further will work as intended.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Git hooks can insert themselves in different stages of the commit lifecycle, we are 
_at least for the time being_ leveraging `pre-commit` and `pre-push`, which before letting us actually 
save the commit to VC it will police our changes.
====

[#hooks]
The **pre-commit** hook we have at the `git-hooks` folder of the repository is **cross-platform**, 
it will run both on **_Windows and Linux_**, depending on the OS it will then execute either 
`pre-commit.sh` or `pre-commit.ps1`.

The **post-commit** hook we have at the `git-hooks` folder is also cross-platform 
and will execute the respective script based on the OS.

The **pre-push** hook we have at the `git-hooks` folder is also cross-platform and will 
execute the respective script based on the OS.

[NOTE]
====
It's worth noting that the moment a hook runs, its executing path will be the root path at 
which we have the `.git` folder. Meaning that based on that starting point all the logic 
we set in place should be built accordingly.

== Windows Setup

All logic specific to Windows, will make use of **powershell**, so any commands specific 
to that CLI are present in here.

The `pre-commit.ps1` script takes care of doing the following tasks:

* Checking code format (according to conventions)
* Building the solution
* Running all tests
* Running `appsettings.json` OAuth credential sanitization by blanking out sensitive fields, 
and backing up the contents for the `post-commit` hook to then finish this specific 
flow
** _NOTE_: Some links in regards to windows specific issues with jq and passing things with 
double quotes:

*** https://github.com/jqlang/jq/issues/2640[double quote fix]

The `post-commit.ps1` script takes care of doing the following tasks:

* Work in conjunction with the `pre-commit.ps1` file so that once its backup `appsettings.json` 
contents are saved in a different file, this then restores all of that into the 
original `appsettings.json` file and deletes the backup file

The `pre-push.ps1` script takes care of doing the following tasks:

* Checking code format (according to conventions)
* Building the solution
* Running all tests
* Running a check for possibly outdated packages
** _NOTE:_ This will never fail, the command only lists out its findings, a good 
still to let people know as they work that something might need an update.
* Running migrations (**TBD**: _This requires for Entity Framework to be installed and 
setup up in a specific project(s)_)
* Running a check on possible vulnerable packages

[IMPORTANT]
====
The difference between the amount of operations each stage has has been configured with intent. 
Whilst simply comitting we shouldn't have to disrupt the developer experience as much since changes might 
get overwritten later, and the _flow state_ might end up taking a hit. However, before trying to push 
something to version control we will run as many checks as we can so that we are not pushing bad code 
that could end up breaking the build.

== Linux Setup

All logic specific to Linux, will make use of **bash**, so any commands specific 
to that CLI are present in here.

The `pre-commit.sh` script takes care of doing the following tasks:

* Checking code format (according to conventions)
* Building the solution
* Running all tests

The `pre-push.sh` script takes care of doing the following tasks:

* Checking code format (according to conventions)
* Building the solution
* Running all tests
* Running a check for possibly outdated packages
** _NOTE:_ This will never fail, the command only lists out its findings, a good 
still to let people know as they work that something might need an update.
* Running migrations (**TBD**: _This requires for Entity Framework to be installed and 
setup up in a specific project(s)_)
* Running a check on possible vulnerable packages
