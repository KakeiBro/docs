= Backend

As mentioned in the xref:domain:index.adoc[domain] section of the docs, we are powering 
the backend with **.NET Core 9**. It will be organized in a Modular Monolith manner, 
powered through **Redis** as its backing service. 

On top of that we will have it orchestrated with Docker (docker-compose), all living 
in its own repository.
