= Security

Most of the advice we will be following will be taken out directly from OWASP's cheatsheets. 

_OWASP:_ A foundation that focuses on improving the security of software through its 
community-led open source software projects.

== Encryption

https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cryptographic_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html#introduction[Reference].

We will apply encryption principles based around _asymetric keys_ for really 
sensitive data that we are assuming the responsibility of. (_A recommendation though is 
to simply avoid storing as much as possible_.)
