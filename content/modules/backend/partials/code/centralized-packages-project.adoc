<1> We have to simply reference centralized packages under a `PackageReference` tag, without versions.
<2> If we want to install specific packages for the project, we can still do it by 
putting explicitly the name and version of it. And this way we connect projects with a 
centralized package versioning file and we get rid of the hassle of having to go through 
each project to update things whilst maintaining specific packages for specific projects.
