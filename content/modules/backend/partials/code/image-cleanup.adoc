<1> Just so that the script gets access to the upstream env variables we need to make 
this assignment (for all variables).
<2> Luckily, we get access to the env variable with our google credentials, this 
should be populated already due to the previous steps that ran before this script. 
(In case this needs to be leveraged elsewhere, be sure to be logged into GCloud before 
trying to run this script)
<3> Unlike the `$ARTIFACT_REGISTRY` value that references both the region plus the 
actual domain, this is simply the region section of that.
<4> The same repository name that we have under _secrets_, this is the root that 
we created at the _Artifact Registry_ level.
<5> And lastly a **_Package_** is the name of the image that's under the repository.
<6> We could use a `--sort_by=~create_time`, however GCloud always returns in Ascending 
(older first), and so we leverage the CLI to inverse the output we get with `tac` 
(that's the inverse of `cat`). That way we will have all the output in descending order 
(newer first), and we start from the 3rd newest onwards. (Again, **two tags** refer to 
the **latest build**, and the last one refers to the **previous commit**).
