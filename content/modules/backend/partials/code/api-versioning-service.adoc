<.> We will start with a default `v1` for our application.
<.> Out of the different versioning schemes that exist, we will use the url segment 
approach, meaning that prefixing each endpoint we will have its version stated `/v1/`, 
`/v2/`.
<.> We will then specify how the template for the version will be constructed, in our 
case is a simple `v` character and then the number of the version right after `V`.
<.> We will also enable the service to be able to replace the endpoint template with 
the respective version when registering endpoints.
