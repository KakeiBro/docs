<1> The moment some IDE analyzer picks up on a rule infraction, it will no longer just show 
as a warning, but as an error.
<2> And the moment a static analyzer picks up on some warning, it will immediately be 
treated as an error.
<3> Lastly, we want for the build to fail the moment some code smell makes its way into 
the codebase.
