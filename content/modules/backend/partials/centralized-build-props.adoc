== Centralized Build Props

Whilst there's certainly patterns that involve having a _shared_ project that holds 
references to both NuGets and General Use classes for a whole solution. We can also 
leverage another type of pattern. And this involves making use of a `Directory.build.props` 
file. Files such as this one can abstract away centralized configurations both for build 
processes (separating concerns such as static analyzer warnings and errors), and 
other cross cutting concerns such as NuGet package versioning.
