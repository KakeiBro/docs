== Centralized NuGet packages

Following the same idea at <<Centralized Build Props>> we can also use a file 
called `Directory.Packages.props`. It is at this file that we can then declare 
all sorts of NuGet packages that we want to be centralized, this 
brings us the benefit of having one version for all projects in one file, instead of 
having to go into each project and managing versions on their own. Now this should be 
definitely used with foresight, since there are use cases the definitely will not benefit 
from this at all.

And now, if we want to reference the packages and have them available, we can simply 
declare them in any project file as such:
