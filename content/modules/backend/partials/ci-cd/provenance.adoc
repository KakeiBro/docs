== Build Push Action Provenance

Provenance metadata includes details about:

- The build environment (e.g, Git commit SHA, timestamp, build parameters)
- The source used for building the image (e.g., repository URL)
- The toolchain used (e.g., Docker BuildKit version)

This metadata helps with **supply chain security** by making builds traceable and 
verifiable, which is useful for **SBOM** (Software Bill of Materials) and **SLSA** (Supply-chain 
Levels for Software Artifacts) compliance.

Turning it **off** does the following:

- It **disables** the inclusion of build provenance metadata in the final image.
- This results in a **smaller** image size.
- It may also improve **build performance** slightly.
- However it **removes traceability**, making it harder to verify the image source 
in security audits.

**When to use it?**

- You **don't need supply chain security features**
- You **want a smaller, simpler image**.
- You're working in a **private, trusted environment**.

**When should you let provenance?**

- You need to **track the origin of builds** (e.g., for compliance reasons)
- You're in a **security-sensitive** environment (e.g., public images, regulated industries)
