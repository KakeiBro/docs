Following https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/dotnet/guide/aaa_oauth[documentation], 
a prototype has been built in order to understand better how to integrate with 
Google OAuth.

The prototype itself is an ASP.NET Core Restful Web API built on .NET 9. The 
repository can be found at https://github.com/KakeiBro/google-oauth[GitHub].

Google has different levels of access, and it has a clear separation between _Authorization_ 
and _Authentication_. But this application itself only leverages half of what Google 
might offer, since we simply want for google to take care of the authentication 
flow for us through a Google Account, we will be using a `web` client type for 
the Google exchange that takes place. 

The steps that one would normally take for a web client authentication flow will 
be:

1. Your application (UI) redirects a browser to a Google URL; the URL includes query 
parameters that indicate the type of access being requested.
2. Google handles the user authentication, session selection, and user consent. 
The result is an authorization code, which the application can exchange for an 
access token and refresh token.
3. The application gets an authorization code that we can later exchange for an 
access token and a refresh token.
4. The application should store the refresh token for future use and use the access 
token to access a Google API. Once the access token expires, the application uses the 
refresh token to obtain a new one.
