When it comes to one really important _CCC_ it is the fact that we need credentials 
from Google in order to hit their endpoints and then on behalf of a user start consuming 
their APIs.

It is due to this, that we have to establish an implementation that accounts for a secure 
way to hydrate the app with the data that only lives on a workstation, and is never 
uploaded to version control.

It was decided that in order to work with this, we have to download the 
`client_secrets.json` file, put it inside the `Application/Files` folder. If the 
file is for the right application registered in **Google Console**, then all flows 
should work correctly.

When putting an app into production we should definitely leverage the `IConfiguration` 
interface and its APIs alongside the usage of environmental variables in order to safely 
hydrate with the right set of credentials at build/deploy times, and not hard-coding it into 
the project.
