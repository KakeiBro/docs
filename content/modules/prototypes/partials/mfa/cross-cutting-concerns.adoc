=== Security

The `Base32Key` is a shared secret between the server and the user's 2FA app. If someone 
else obtains this key, they can generate valid TOTP codes for that user. To 
mitigate this risk:

* Only display the QR code temporarily. Once the user sets up their 2FA, the secret 
key should never be displayed again.
* Avoid logging or caching the key anywhere (e.g. logs, temporary files).
* When storing the `Base32Key` in your database, always encrypt it to protect it at rest. 
Use a robust encryption library, to encrypt and decrypt the secret key securely.
* Ensure HTTPS Everywhere, if the `otpAuth://` ORL or QR code is ever transmitted over 
the network (e.g., to a front end), ensure the connection is secured using **HTTPS**. 
This prevents interception of the secret key during setup.
* Once the user scans the QR code and sets up 2FA, avoid showing the secret key or 
QR code again. If the user loses access, you can generate a new key but never reuse the 
old one.
* Don't log the Key or URL: Ensure you don't log sensitive details like the base32Key 
or the otpauth:// URL.
* If an attacker obtains the secret key, they could generate codes indefinitely. 
To mitigate this:
** Consider implementing device-based trust where users must re-authenticate for new 
devices.
** Use the secret key **only for authentication** and avoid repurposing it for other 
use cases.
* **Server-Side Key Verification:** Instead of exposing the base32Key to the frontend, 
you can handle the TOTP directly on the server side.
** Generate and store the secret key on the server.
** Create and display only the QR code (without sending the raw base32Key to the user).
** Validate user-entered TOTP codes directly against the server-stored secret key.
* **Backup Codes for Recovery**
** Provide users with one-time backup codes during setup to allow them to regain access 
if they lose their 2FA device. These codes should:
*** Be stored hashed in your database, like passwords.
*** Only be shown to the user during setup.
*** Be invalidated upon use.

=== Platform Independence

Since we don't want to be hard-coupled to an operative system we have to use cross-platform 
libraries and classes. **QRCoder** has a way to work with MS' `Bitmap`. But if we were to 
put the system in Linux this implementation would break, luckily there's a `QRCoder-ImageSharp` 
NuGet that can enable us using `ImageSharp` to work with graphics in a cross-platform 
manner.

=== Usability

==== QR Codes

Inside of `OtpNet` there are a couple of settings to keep in mind in order to understand 
how they serve a purpose.

There's specifically a line of code that goes like this:

```
using var qrCodeData = qrGenerator.CreateQrCode(otpAuthUrl, QRCodeGenerator.ECCLevel.Q);
```

The `ECCLevel` Enum hints at different levels for this specific setting, we can 
break it down as follows:

- ECCLevel means _Code Error Correction Levels_. QR codes specifically use **Reed-Solomon** 
error correction, which allows them to recover lost or corrupted data. There are four levels 
of error correction, each balancing data recovery and storage capacity:
-- L (Low): Recovers up to **7%** of the QR code data. This is the best when the QR 
Code is expected to be in pristine condition and you need to maximize storage capacity 
(more data fits in the QR code).
-- M (Medium): Recovers up to **15%** of the QR code data. This is the `default level` 
and provides a balance between storage capacity and error correction. Good for general 
use cases where slight damage or distortion might occur.
-- Q (Quartile): Recovers up to **25%** of the QR code data. Used in situations where 
moderate damage is expected, such as printing QR codes on physical materials.
-- H (High): Recovers up to **30%** of the QR code data. Provides the highest level 
of error correction but reduces storage capacity (the QR code size will increase to 
compensate). Suitable for highly critical scenarios such as Outdoor signage, QR codes 
in rough environments (e.g., packaging or industrial use), artistic designs (logos or 
overlays) that intentionally obscure parts of the QR code.

A higher ECC levels result in:

- More redundancy, which increases the QR code's robustness.
- Larger QR codes (more pixels or modules) because additional space is used for error 
correction data.

Lower ECC levels prioritize compactness but are less tolerant to damage.

_For general use (like digital screens), the default `M` is usually sufficient_.

==== Time Sensitiveness

The TOTP algorithm makes use of the Unix Time, and its epochs, tied into intervals 
of time that can be then matched with an external secret key, in order to validate if 
across time, the code provided at **a** specific time was valid.

The `RFC 6238 standard` specifices how OTPs (TOTP) work. It is there that the Verification 
Windows is stated to accept slightly out-of-sync codes. (Server looking at a code from 
a client, meaning client could be slightly out of sync). The network delay considers 
this small of window under the assumptions that there could be: network delays, slight 
clock skews between the server and the client device.

By default the **verification window** accepts one time step before and after the current 
time step. For example:

- If the time step interval is 30 seconds: It will accept codes generated up to 30 seconds 
before and 30 seconds after the current time.

**What is a time step?**

In TOTP, the _time step_ is a small interval of time (usually 30 seconds) during which 
a single OTP code is valid. The TOTP algorithm generates a new code for each time step, 
based on:

- The shared secret key (`key` in your code).
- The number of time steps that you have elapsed since the Unix epoch

If a code is valid, it means that said code matched to some specific time step for 
a specific key. You can use that time step number for debugging or logging to see 
if the user's device is out-of-sync with the server.

A time step number is based on the intervals that go from the Unix epoch to an arbitrary 
point in time. Say today _10-December-2024 11:35:22_, in 30-second intervals, we would be 
at step (not actually calculated) 12345. We would use the TOTP algorithm to see if a code 
provided as an input matches to this step (or at least to the previous and/or following step). 
If we can match it to them, then the code should be valid.
