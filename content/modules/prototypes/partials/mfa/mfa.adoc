Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a process in which a user is requested during 
a sign-in event for additional forms of identification. This prompt could be to enter 
a code from a cellphone, use a FIDO2 key, or to provide a fingerprint scan. **When 
you require a second form of authentication, security is enhanced. The additional 
factor isn't easily obtained or duplicated by a cyberattacker.**

MFA requires at least two or more types of proof for an identity like something you 
know, something you possess, or biometric validation for the user to authenticate.

Two-factor authentication (2FA) is like a subset of MFA, but the difference being that 
MFA can require two or more factors to prove the identity.

_Small note:_ 2FA is supported by default when using ASP.NET Core Identity. To enable 
or disable 2FA for a specific user, set the `IdentityUser<TKey>.TwoFactorEnabled` 
property.

Inside of MFA, there's **TOTP**, (Time-based One-time Password Algorithm). Compliant 
apps such as Microsoft Authenticator and Google Authenticator can be tied to any 
implementation following said algorithm.
