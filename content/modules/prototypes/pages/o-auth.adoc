= Google OAuth 2.0

Following https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/dotnet/guide/aaa_oauth[documentation], 
a prototype has been built in order to understand better how to integrate with 
Google OAuth.

The prototype itself is an ASP.NET Core Restful Web API built on .NET 9. The 
repository can be found at https://github.com/KakeiBro/google-oauth[GitHub].

== Usage

The project is pretty simple, there are , Postman can be used in order to hit them, 
however, due to the integration with `.http` files, even at the IDE level we can 
hit the endpoints with no issue whatsoever. Just open up any of these files and 
then click on the `Send Request` button that pops up.
