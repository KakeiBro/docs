:navtitle: Introduction

KakeiBro, is a play on words with the Japanese word "Kakeibo" (家計簿). Which literally 
translates to "House Ledger Book". Whilst this is just a name for an object, in the 
Japanese space it goes beyond just that. It's a way of keeping track of finances by 
yourself with a set of guidelines and concepts that help you understand how your money 
flows and how to better manage it.
