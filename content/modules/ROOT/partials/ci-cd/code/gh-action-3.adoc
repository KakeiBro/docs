<1> A _pain point_ with GitHub Actions is that you can't configure them to just skip 
over everything after a certain point. And so, since we want to short-circuit any subsequent 
steps in case no change to the docs was detected, we will have to add a conditional step 
instruction in every subsequent step.
<2> We do a normal setup of dependencies we need to work with node modules, (by taking 
advantage of caching and pnpm). After we have setup everything, we run the `antora` 
module and then use as a playbook reference the `master-playbook`. This will take 
care of cloning the https://github.com/KakeiBro/docs[docs] repository and then bringing 
everything together to then have an artifact that's a folder `build/site/`. In here we 
have an `index.html` site
