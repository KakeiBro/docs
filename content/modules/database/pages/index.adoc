= Database

Based on the needs of an application we can choose to make use of different data models 
for storing the data.

- Document databases
- Relational databases
- Graph databases

Reference: https://a.co/d/gbnpdgS[Designing Data-Intensive Applications: The Big Ideas Behind Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Systems]

It's hard to say which approach is better, unless we go into the details of the 
type of application we are going to be building. For our specific purposes, being 
that we are going to deal with _personal finances_. But not in a highly interconnected 
way in which we have tons of many-to-many relationships and the need to perform tons 
of joins into them for different cross-user querying. We will follow a _document database_ 
approach.

Specifically, we will leverage `Redis OM`. Which is a specific library 
(that is built on top of StackExchange.Redis) that leverages Redis' native JSON 
document data type to store data to then connect that to an application by becoming a 
translation layer at the level of an **Object Mapper**.

The document's structure will try to leverage _locality_ as much as possible, having 
all the xref:domain:ubiquitous-language.adoc#bookkeeper[bookkeeper's] information 
under the same document, allowing for us to have access to data related to him and his 
finances without the need for _client-side joining_. And it's also due to the _start-upy_ 
nature of the whole project, in which new ideas might start coming later, and/or we require 
for a fast development experience without too many hurdles that **schema-_ful_** databases 
might impose. (But it's worth noting that the integration with EF Core (in .NET specifically), 
allows for this overhead to be greatly simplified, since the concept of automated migrations 
auto-generated from the object's we write at the application level is a god-send when 
used correctly).

== Conventions

And since a clear line needs to be drawn, these are the conventions we will use 
for the different aspects of our database:

- Database names => `snake_case` (Documents, fields, constraints) (always in plural)
- Primary IDs => `id` or `document_id`
- Document references => `document_id`
- Indexes/constraints => `idx_`, `fk_`, `chk_`

And due to the Document based nature of how we will store our data in Redis, the diagram 
we chose to represent it will be of a _Class Diagram_, however with a <<Documents diagram, _tree-like structure_.>>
It's **imperative** to leave clear that we will store inside of a parent object 
in which all the other children will hold themselves other levels of data.

And it's also important to state clearly that Redis is a **key-value** store. It's not 
relational in nature, and it doesn't enforce schemas like SQL databases. It's through 
the usage of its own convention in the form of _key paths_ that we will be able to store our documents 
with a clear logical order in mind. It will be through this usage that we will also 
adhere to the xref:backend:net-modulith/net-modulith.adoc[modular monolith] architecture pattern, 
specifically on the concern of isolating data between modules.

Another important convention we will always aim at adhering to is **to never physically 
delete records**. (Unless a compelling argument arises for doing so). We should always 
have a `deleted` field with a `true` representing the record is logically deleted (or not).

== Key Paths

We will hold a structure such as:

* auth 
** user (E.g., `auth:user:1`)
* finances (E.g., `finances:*`)
** TBD
* intelligence (E.g., `intelligence:*`)
** TBD
* users (E.g., `users:*`)
** TBD
* projection (E.g., `projection:*`)
** TBD

And it's each entry that will correspond to a numeral ID that we will 
have our documents saved to. As you can see the **parent key path** will be of the 
**respective module**.

== Documents diagram

We will document each module's data document structure in isolation (following the idea 
of the _Modular Monolith_ approach), but also for simplicity and readability's sake.

=== Authentication Module

_Figure 1. Authentication module's data model_

* `users` is the heart of this module (_aggregate root in DDD_), it will save data that Google's 
API will provide on the initial xref:domain:ubiquitous-language.adoc#auth-handshake[handshake] 
plus storing in a nested document array the different tokens that might be created across the usage 
of the system. **_BIG NOTE:_** Each new record on the `tokens` collection should have 
its `value` field blanked out the moment it's marked as `deleted` for security purposes 
(plus having that same token revoked on the Google side). +
Also attached to the user we will have a list of different MFA devices in case the 
user configures one.

**Extra Note:** One of the most important pieces of information on this module will be 
the `email` from a user, plus a `value` from a token attached to the user. It's due 
to this very fact that those two values must be xref:backend:security.adoc[encrypted] 
and only decrypted at run-time for specific usage of their underlying values.

One key part of this whole module's data model is the fact that we are using `int` 
as the ID for each document. This is _on purpose_ to have an easier time tying that 
back to the _Redis keypaths_, being that if we were to use GUIDs of any nature, the 
readability and ease of search for records would be vastly more challenging. (For other 
use cases, a GUID would be more suited, specially if we know that an `int` would reach 
its maximum value over time on the system).
