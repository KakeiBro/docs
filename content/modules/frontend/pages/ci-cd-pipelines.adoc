= CI/CD Pipelines

First of all, the pipelines will be built using Github Actions, and they will be 
all the way to deployment (Continous Integration/Continuous **Deployment**). With 
that in mind we will break down the phylosophy of how they are setup and key points 
to take into consideration.

[NOTE]
====
By convention pipelines are setup in `.yml` files that are comitted to the repository. 
They should be all under `.github/workflows/`.
