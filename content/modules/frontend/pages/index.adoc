= Frontend

As mentioned in the xref:domain:index.adoc[domain] section of the docs the web app 
will be built with **React**. But just like any other application we need to choose 
an architectural pattern to base our folder structure and workflow around.

[NOTE]
====
For further information to the chosen architecture pattern please head to 
xref:ui-folder-structure-patterns.adoc[]

== Setup

The project was generated with `vite`. Using the command:

- `pnpm create vite@latest kakeibro-web` (Select React > Typescript + SWC)
- `pnpm install`
