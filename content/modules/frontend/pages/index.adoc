= Frontend

As mentioned in the xref:domain:index.adoc[domain] section of the docs the web app 
will be built with **React**. But just like any other application we need to choose 
an architectural pattern to base our folder structure and workflow around, and also 
designate code styles, plus sanity checks (baked into the developer experience).

[NOTE]
====

== Setup

The project was generated with `vite`. Using the command:

- `pnpm create vite@latest kakeibro-web` (Select React > Typescript + SWC)
- `pnpm install`

=== Formatter and Linter

Because `vite` follows best practices and modern web development practices, it 
already comes with **eslint** integrated, and its auto-generated `README` also has instructions 
on how to extend the configuration so that we get a richer dev experience with the linter.

The formatter will be `prettier`, however, we are not going to leverage multiple 
libraries running on their own, mostly because there are conflicts with eslint most of 
the time, however, due to this fact, eslint has a specific plugin that helps bridging 
its own rules with prettier (plus leveraging the package on its backend). Hence we 
will install eslint's prettier integration:

```
pnpm i --D eslint-plugin-prettier eslint-config-prettier
pnpm i --D --E prettier
```
Just so that we stick to one prettier version without it dragging into new versions that 
might break our project we use `--save-exact` or `--E`. And because all of these libraries 
are solely for dev purposes we will install them as dev dependencies `--save-dev` or `-D`

Once this is done it's advisable to set your IDE to use ESLint as its default formatter, 
(as we mentioned before, with the prettier plugin it will leverage prettier as the 
code formatter on the backend).

In case there are other plugins such as prettier, standardjs, etc installed it is 
advisable to have them disabled on the project's workspace due to our philosophy of 
leveraging all of these tools as **packages** and through configuration files that 
allow for all of the setup to be transferable across all developers, we don't want for 
IDE plugins with their own set of rules to interfere. The only plugin that should be 
leveraged to get intellisense, code fixes, and other things through the IDE's plugin 
reading our config files and packages should be **ESLint**

[NOTE]
====
In the case of VS Code, the moment we establish configurations for the workspace 
such as the default formatter a `.vscode` folder will be created with all of this 
in mind. _COMMIT THIS FOLDER_. So that any other developer that opens up the folder 
with VS Code it will automatically pick up on the setup.
====

This project specifically works with ESLint's **_Flat Config_** configuration. Which 
is the new ESLint way of configuring things, and so, the plugin on the IDE should be 
set to follow this:

[IMPORTANT]
====
It's worth noting that both `eslint` and `prettier` are more catered as their own 
tools that run on the command line and take care of highlighting errors and fixing 
them accordingly, with that in mind, we can always head to their github repositories 
in order to read about what you can do with them. But for our specific use case, we 
want to use them to so that we can format things according to **one** code line, and 
so that the IDE also picks up on rules that are being inflicted so that the developer is 
moved towards coding with the specific guidelines
====

With that in mind, the `settings.json` that's at `.vscode` should look something like 
this:

[source, json]
----
{
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "dbaeumer.vscode-eslint",
    "editor.formatOnSave": true,
    "editor.codeActionsOnSave": { <1>
        "source.fixAll.eslint": "explicit" <2>
    },
    "eslint.useFlatConfig": true,
}
----
<1> This is key, we are sort of configuring a _macro_ that when hitting the Save key 
on the IDE we are running "something".
<2> In our case we want to run `eslint` and fix all errors that it might encounter, 
it used to be `true`, but there's a warning stating that it will be deprecated for the 
`explicit` value.

Once that's configured everytime we hit `Save`, then eslint (integrated with prettier) 
should run and fix as much errors and warnings it might highlight (and of course follow 
any prettier rules that are also enforced).

Here's the breakdown of the configurations that were setup:
