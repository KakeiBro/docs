= UI Folder Structure Patterns

Organizing a React application's folder structure is crucial for maintainability, 
scalability, and collaboration.

== Architecture-tied

Based on the vast amount of architecture patterns that exist, we can start combining 
concepts together to come up with different folder structure patterns, the most used ones 
in **React** applications could be:

=== Feature-Based Folder Structure

include::partial$folder-patterns/feature-based.adoc[]

=== Layered Architecture (Presentation, Business Logic, Data)

include::partial$folder-patterns/layered-architecture.adoc[]

=== Atomic Design Pattern

include::partial$folder-patterns/atomic-design.adoc[]

=== Modular Architecture

include::partial$folder-patterns/modular-architecture.adoc[]

=== Flat Structure

include::partial$folder-patterns/flat-structure.adoc[]

=== Ducks Pattern (for Redux)

include::partial$folder-patterns/ducks-pattern.adoc[]

=== Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

include::partial$folder-patterns/ddd.adoc[]

**Choosing the Right Pattern**

- **Small Apps:** Use a Flat Structure or Atomic Design
- **Medium Apps:** Use **Feature-Based** or **Modular Architecture**
- **Large Apps:** Use **Layered Architecture**, **Domain-Driven Design**, or 
**Ducks Pattern** (if using Redux)

The best pattern will depend on the team's preference, the size of the application, 
and the complexity of the business logic.

== KakeiBro's Choice

When it comes to designing a folder structure that is based on an architectural pattern, 
we definitely have to look at it from multiple perspectives, whilst a checklist might 
be enough for some, it's through experience and a _feel_ for how the project would evolve 
and the type of people that it will require that we need to make **_as close of a good choice_ **
as we can. Nothing's off the table technically, but this choice should be based on factual 
and time-aware data (meaning knowing about the current state of both the dev team and 
the tech stack).

One other concept that was used in order to make the decision was of **Screaming Architecture**. 
The pattern itself focuses on the idea that the code bases we build, extend and maintain 
should constantly be giving queues to the developers about the _Domain_ of the software. 
We add extra buffers and overhead to the development process when trying to separate 
our units of code into technical concerns (BI, Repository, etc). Whereas the way to 
really understand and keep a mental map of the software, is by connecting all of the 
technical implementations **with the actual problem the software solves.**. It is by 
doing this that we add more intuitive and extendable choices for a developer.

This obviously has to be architected with intent, and not just following like _dogma_, 
every software is different, and tons of variables come into play when coming up with 
the solution, _that not always is the best_, but we have to get our foot off the starting 
line somehow. We should follow **iterative principles** and always aim at making the 
software better if an issue with a design choice manifests itself.

With all of that said, the architecture that was chosen for the UI project was 
**Feature Based**. Meaning that we will follow an idea like so:

```
src/
├── features/
│   ├── auth/
│   │   ├── components/
│   │   ├── hooks/
│   │   ├── services/
│   │   ├── store/ (for Redux)
│   │   └── index.ts
│   ├── users/
│   │   ├── components/
│   │   ├── hooks/
│   │   ├── services/
│   │   └── index.ts
│   ├── finances/
│   │   ├── components/
│   │   ├── hooks/
│   │   ├── services/
│   │   └── index.ts
|   └── intelligence/
│       ├── components/
│       ├── hooks/
│       ├── services/
│       └── index.ts
├── shared/
│   ├── components/ (reusable UI components)
│   ├── hooks/ (reusable hooks)
│   ├── utils/ (utility functions)
│   └── styles/ (global styles)
├── App.tsx
└── index.ts
```

If you notice, the **features** have the same names as the _modules_ that are present 
in our xref:domain:index.adoc[Domain Driven Design] page.

We should always follow this design line, and stick to it, if a use case ever arises 
that we are not sure where it fits, a discussion on how to extend the initial spec should 
take place.
