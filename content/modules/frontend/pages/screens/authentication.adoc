_Figure 1._ High Level View of Login Screens

As mentioned in xref:domain:authentication-module.adoc[the domain section], we will 
follow specific flows that are relying entirely on **Google Auth**, if we have a 
xref:domain:ubiquitous-language.adoc#guest[Guest], we will make them go through 
Google Auth's screens on a minimized new window, once the flow is done, the main 
screen should refresh automatically and throw the user into the `Home` screen.

If we are dealing with xref:domain:ubiquitous-language.adoc#internal-user[an internal user], 
in case its token grace period has expired, we will just show an error message below the 
e-mail input indicating for the user to run the Google Auth flow again, and simply 
follow the same flow as it would be for a **_guest_**. _In case the token is still valid_ 
we will immediately show the Home Screen.

[NOTE]
====
Everything will appear to run on the same screens, but the backend will have to account 
for the different situations and make the right calls and right processing of data.
