= Husky Setup

Husky is a https://typicode.github.io/husky/[tool] in charge of policing git commits 
and/or pushes, before comitting anything to version control, before even saving a commit 
it can run linting, formatting, and other type of logic, that in case it fails it 
will short-circuit the process.

Husky is installed as a node package:

- `pnpm add --save-dev husky`

And due to the nature of our setup we have to setup husky in a specific way so that 
it makes use of the parent folder's `.git` whilst being inside of a folder one level 
below: (https://typicode.github.io/husky/how-to.html#project-not-in-git-root-directory[reference]).

After adding husky we can try and run `npx husky init`. However this will fail since 
it doesn't find the `.git` folder at our React App folder, hence we have to set it 
up manually.

----
"scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "tsc -b && vite build",
    "lint": "eslint .",
    "preview": "vite preview",
    "prepare": "cd .. && husky kakeibro-web/.husky" <1>
  },
----
<1> The `prepare` script will be created already, however you have to configure it 
so that we go to the `.git` folder level. And then apply husky from the `.husky` 
folder at the app folder level.

Right after this, the `pre-commit` hook should be configured as follows:

```
cd kakeibro-web
pnpm lint
```

Once that's done, by running a `pnpm run prepare`, inside of the `.husky/` folder 
necessary files that hook into git and add the logic will be auto-generated. Right 
after those files are generated every time we try to commit something, all the logic 
in the hooks under `.husky/` should run and stop us from comitting things that are not up to 
snuff.

Now, this is setup for **a setup installation**, the power of having setup husky in 
a `prepare` script is that next time someone runs a `pnpm install` **this script will 
run as well** and **it will have husky setup for that specific workstation**. This 
is great, since developers will not have to worry about this setup whatsoever.

The main reasons as to why husky is so great is:

- One-time setup, open for extensions.
- Eases up the onboarding project, since any new workstation that wants to run the project 
will have the pre-commit and hooks already configured after a `pnpm install`. We leverage 
node and the module to take care of all the grunt work (_seamless_).

== About Husky's Hooks

Unlike the xref:backend:git-hooks.adoc[Backend Hooks] approach, we will simplify things 
a bit by leveraging **Node**. And so, all hooks that are under `.husky/*` in theory 
are expecting to run on a https://typicode.github.io/husky/how-to.html#non-shell-hooks[POSIX compliant CLI] 
however, due to our cross-platform requirement, we are going to put all the logic behind 
a javascript file and we are going to run it with `Node`.

And so the raw hook files should just reference the respective `.js` file, e.g:

```
cd kakeibro-web
node .husky/pre-commit.js
```

Just as normal git hooks, the starting path will always be the root repository where 
`.git` is at. But it's here where things can get a bit different than the raw git hooks approach.

First of all, we are leveraging **pnpm**, so everything is catered to how that specific tool works. Since 
we will be running on `node`, we get access to `pnpm`, however, it's through the leveraging of its 
https://pnpm.io/pnpm-cli#commands[fallback configuration] that we can simply register scripts at `package.json` 
and then try to run them by inputting something like `pnpm <script-name>`. 
Looking at the `.js` files that are next to the husky hooks, we will see how we are by the 
most part making usage of those scripts. Except for the one specific check that will be explained 
in a moment.

=== Pre-Commit Script

The `pre-commit.js` hook script takes care of:

* Running `ESLint` (it will not auto-fix the errors, developers will be forced to take notice of this and hopefully 
learn from it).
** **HINT:** Since `prettier` is installed, the command can be run to take care of stragglers.
* Running `tsc and vite build` to make sure nothing in the solution is broken.
* Running **_custom node logic_** to scan all files in the project and pick up on any `console.log` or 
`debugger` statements and fail if it does find them. A way to do it with a script and "easier" would be by 
using `grep`, but since **Windows** is not POSIX compliant, it doesn't have `grep` installed by default and 
this accounts for that possible error case. 

=== Pre=Push Script

The `pre-push.js` hook script takes care of:

* Running `ESLint` (it will not auto-fix the errors, developers will be forced to take notice of this and hopefully 
learn from it).
** **HINT:** Since `prettier` is installed, the command can be run to take care of stragglers.
* Running `tsc and vite build` to make sure nothing in the solution is broken.
* Running a check for possible **outdated packages**, this follows the idea of the _backend hooks_ behavior, in the 
sense that it has been configured to not fail, (this would fail if it does find it), it will only be a 
warning, and hopefully a point when pushing for a developer to take notice that some packages might be 
getting left behind on the release lifecycle.
* Running **_custom node logic_** to scan all files in the project and pick up on any `console.log` or 
`debugger` statements and fail if it does find them. A way to do it with a script and "easier" would be by 
using `grep`, but since **Windows** is not POSIX compliant, it doesn't have `grep` installed by default and 
this accounts for that possible error case.
* Running a script to **check for outdated packages** we have, _if any new version is found its default 
behavior is to fail_. Updating node packages sometimes might be really disruptive, hence we don't want 
to just update for the sake of updating, hence this will fail silently, whilst still 
printing about the new versions found to the developer to be mindful about them.
* Running a script to **check for packages with vulnerabilities**, this is way more important 
than just outdated packages, so this will fail if something is found and the dev team should 
put efforts immediately to update the package (alongside all possible errors that might show due to said 
update).

[IMPORTANT]
====
The difference between the amount of operations each stage has has been configured with intent. 
Whilst simply comitting we shouldn't have to disrupt the developer experience as much since changes might 
get overwritten later, and the _flow state_ might end up taking a hit. However, before trying to push 
something to version control we will run as many checks as we can so that we are not pushing bad code 
that could end up breaking the build. **_However_**, the amount of time it takes for the frontend hooks 
to run is way shorter than the ones at the **backend** side, hence the differences in here are not as many.
