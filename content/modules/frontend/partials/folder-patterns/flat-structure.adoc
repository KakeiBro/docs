This pattern keeps the folder structure simple and flat, with minimal nesting

```
src/
├── components/ (all components)
├── hooks/ (custom hooks)
├── pages/ (page-level components)
├── services/ (API calls)
├── styles/ (global styles)
├── utils/ (utility functions)
├── App.js
├── index.js
└── routes.js (if using React Router)
```

When to Use:

- Small applications or prototypes
- Teams that prefer simplicity and minimal structure
- Applications with limited complexity
