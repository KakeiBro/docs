This pattern organizes component based on their complexity and reusability, following 
the **Atomic Design** methodology.

```
src/
├── atoms/ (smallest components, e.g., buttons, inputs)
├── molecules/ (combinations of atoms, e.g., search bar)
├── organisms/ (combinations of molecules, e.g., header, footer)
├── templates/ (page layouts)
├── pages/ (page-level components)
├── hooks/ (custom hooks)
├── utils/ (utility functions)
├── styles/ (global styles)
├── App.js
├── index.js
└── routes.js (if using React Router)
```

When to Use:

- Applications with a strong focus on reusable components
- Design systems or component libraries
- Teams that want to enforce a consistent design language
