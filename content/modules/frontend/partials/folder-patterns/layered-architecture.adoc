This pattern separates the application into **layers** based on their responsibilities: 
presentation, business logic, and data.

```
src/
├── presentation/
│   ├── components/ (UI components)
│   ├── pages/ (page-level components)
│   └── layouts/ (layout components)
├── business/
│   ├── hooks/ (custom hooks for business logic)
│   ├── services/ (API calls, business logic)
│   └── store/ (Redux or Zustand store)
├── data/
│   ├── api/ (API configuration and endpoints)
│   ├── models/ (data models or interfaces)
│   └── utils/ (data-related utilities)
├── App.js
├── index.js
└── routes.js (if using React Router)
```

When to use:

- Applications with complex business logic
- Teams that want clear separation of concerns
- Applications that need to scale with a focus on maintainability
